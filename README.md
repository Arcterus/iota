# Rdit

Rdit is a terminal-based text-editor written in Rust.

This is really an experimental project that I'm using as I learn Rust.
It's very basic right now, just opening existing files and moving the cursor 
around. One day it will be a "real" editor, though! (maybe)

I've never built an editor before, so this is new territory for me. Please
don't look at the early history of the project, it's full of my silly
mistakes and awful workarounds as I try figure out how this all works.
